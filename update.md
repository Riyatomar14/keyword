## computer is divided into three parts-

# 1.computation 
> host-basically a bare metal(server with no operating system)
> VM(virtual machine)-virtualization 
  type-1 (server with no operating system) ex:XEN,KVM
  type-2 (server with operating system) EX: VIRTUAL BOX

  OVS (open virtual switch)
> CONTAINER
  -Docker container
  -linux container(LXC)

  ORCHESTRATION CONTAINERS(manage service with container)
  -KUBERNETES(K8S)
  -DOCKER SWARM
  -MESOS
  -EKS(Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service)
  -ECS(Elastic container service)   
> user space and kernel space

# 2.networking
>LOAD BALANCER-help to overcome the traffic
>SMART NICS-
  DPDK-transfer TCP packets from operating system kernel to processing running space in user space.
  SR-IOV-allows a device, such as a network adapter, to separate access to its resources among various PCIe hardware functionsand help in optimization gives efficiency.
>proxy and reverse proxy
>NAT
>routing
>ROUTE 53(DNS)
 LAYER 4 (TCP AND UDP)
>CNI
>LAYER 7 (PRESENTATION AND DATA LINK)

# 3.storage 
 > block storage ex:EBS
 > OBJECT STORAGE ex:S3
 > db
> caching ex:redish

## architecture
> api gateway- act as mediator between server and client.
> ELK STORAGE
