Hi guys, I like to share some technical words which are important for computer science student. 
1.*DESKTOP*--> Desktop mainly divided into three parts-
           1. Computation  2.Storage  3. Network
2.*SOME TERMS* -
CPU-central processing unit 
GPU-graphic processing unit 
DPU-data processing unit
TPU-tensor processing unit
3.*CISC[complex instruction set computer]*--closed source like intel and AMD(advanced micro devices).It develop X-86 series under ISA[intruction set arichtecture] in 1978. 
4*RISC[reduced instruction set computer]*--close source like ARM[Adavnce risc machine] .It has specific intruction,very fast and efficient.
5.*RISC-V*--it is based on RISC principles and develop in 2023 and which is a free open source.  
6.*KERNEL*--that manages operations between computer and hardware.
#kernel programing language-
C,C++,rust
7.*OPERATING SYSTEM to store data-
1.Windows
2.MacOS
Windows-
It is developed by Microsoft and it is a close source.It is taken by bill gates.
macOs-
It is a close source and it is developed by apple inc.it is a primary source ffor apple,mac computer.
Now focus on LINUX -
It is open source operting system made by linus torvalds.It contain two spaces KERNEL AND USER SPACE.Came under UNIX[uniplexed information computer sysytem]. 
LINUX has two types of family-
1.Debian 
2.RHEL
Debian family-
It contain OPERATING SYSTEM like UBUNTU[open source,developed by CANONICAL],KALI LINUX.
RHEL[red hat enterprise linux]-
It contain OPERATING SYSTEM likre centOS,oracle,fedora,red hat.
Packing manager: Yum 
It is owned by IBM[international business machine] at 40 billon dollor.
Now, NETWORK
There are two types of network-
1.Internet[(WAN-wide area network) and it is a public network]
2.Intranet[(LAN-local area network) and it is a private network]
Now,CLOUD COMPUTING
CLOUD means internet which is a publioc network[distributed over multiple location.
1.AWS[amazon web services]-by amazon
2.AZURE-by microsoft
3.GCP[Google Cloud Platform]-by google
Now, focus on terms-
1.IP Address
2.DNS[domain name server]
3.Routing
#Ip address[internet protocol]-a unique address which identify the device on internet or on local internet .There are three types of ip address-
*Private-ex:10. ,172. ,192. . 
*Public- ex:11.. 
*Local-ex:127.0.00[a specific number]
like JIO-ipv6, airtel-ipv4.
#DNS[domain name server]-ex:google.com
#Routing-the process of path selection in any network.
now, KEYWORD 1.BARE METAL for fresh server[which has no operating sysytem]
             2.DUAL BOOT-2 operating system 
HYPERVISOR -A program used to run and manage two or more virtual machine.
There are two type of hypervisor-
1.type-1
2.type-2
type-1 -- there is no need to install operating system.
Bare metal-->hypervisor type-1-->VM1,VM2,VM3
type2--there is a need to install operating system .
bare metal-->install operating system-->VM1,VM2,VM3-->type 2[
