Hi guys, I like to share some technical words which a computer science student has to study this a whole life.
DESKTOP--> Desktop mainly divided into three parts-
           1. Computation  2.Storage  3. Network  
Now focus on some terms -
CPU-central processing unit 
GPU-graphic processing unit 
DPU-data processing unit
TPU-tensor processing unit
 We see some popular company and their functions-
1.INTEL
2.AMD
3.ARM
Intel and AMD(advanced micro devices)-
They come under CISC[complex instruction set computer].It is a closed source and this is a low level language.It develop X-86 series under ISA[intruction set arichtecture] in 1978. 
ARM[Adavnce risc machine]-
It come under RISC[reduced instruction set computer].It is a close source and this a high level language.It has specific intruction,very fast and efficient.It develop RISC-V in 2023 and which is a free open source for peoples.  
NOTE POINT --
1. AMD processors are more power efficient.
2. AMD processors are more cheaper than intel.
3. RISC-V is low cost and give high performance than CISC. 
We need some OPERATING SYSTEM to store data-
