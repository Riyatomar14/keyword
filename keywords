Hi guys, I like to share some technical words which are important for computer science student. 
1.*DESKTOP*--> Desktop mainly divided into three parts-
           1. Computation  2.Storage  3. Network
2.*SOME TERMS* -
CPU-central processing unit 
GPU-graphic processing unit 
DPU-data processing unit
TPU-tensor processing unit
3.*CISC[complex instruction set computer]*--closed source like intel and AMD(advanced micro devices).It develop X-86 series under ISA[intruction set arichtecture] in 1978. 
4*RISC[reduced instruction set computer]*--close source like ARM[Adavnce risc machine] .It has specific intruction,very fast and efficient.
5.*RISC-V*--it is based on RISC principles and develop in 2023 and which is a free open source.  
6.*KERNEL*--that manages operations between computer and hardware.

#kernel programing language-
C,C++,rust
7.*OPERATING SYSTEM*-
a.Windows
b.MacOS
8.*LINUX*-It is open source operting system made by linus torvalds.Came under UNIX[uniplexed information computer sysytem]. 
LINUX has two types of family-
a.Debian-It contain OPERATING SYSTEM like UBUNTU[open source,developed by CANONICAL],KALI LINUX.
b.RHEL[red hat enterprise linux]-It contain OPERATING SYSTEM likre centOS,oracle,fedora,red hat.
Packing manager: Yum 
It is owned by IBM[international business machine] at 40 billon dollor.
9.*NETWORK*
There are two types of network-
1.Internet[(WAN-wide area network) and it is a public network]
2.Intranet[(LAN-local area network) and it is a private network]
10.*CLOUD COMPUTING*
CLOUD means internet which is a public network[distributed over multiple location].
a.AWS[amazon web services]-by amazon
b.AZURE-by microsoft
c.GCP[Google Cloud Platform]-by goggle
11.*Ip address[internet protocol]*-a unique address which identify the device on internet or on local internet .There are three types of ip address-
*Private*-ex:starts with 10. ,172. ,192. . 
*Public*- ex:starts with 11.. 
*Local*-ex:starts with 127.0.00[a specific number]
like JIO-ipv6, airtel-ipv4.
12.*DNS[domain name server]*-ex:google.com
13.*Routing*-the process of path selection in any network.
14.*BARE METAL* -fresh server[which has no operating sysytem]
15.*DUAL BOOT*-2 operating system 
16.*HYPERVISOR* -A program used to run and manage two or more virtual machine.
There are two type of hypervisor-
a.type-1
b.type-2
17.*type-1* -- there is no need to install operating system.
Bare metal-->hypervisor type-1-->VM1,VM2,VM3..
18.*type2*--there is a need to install operating system .
bare metal-->install operating system-->VM1,VM2,VM3-->type 2[VM1,VM2,VM3..,Virtual box,work station,VM Ware]
19.*VM WARE*-it is a company of cloud computing and a open source(oracle),owned by broad com(62 billon$)
20.*GPPR*--general data protection regulation
21.*FAANG,MAANG,MERN*
22.*FPGA*-field programmable gate array
23.Company only make silicon chip
a.*taiwan* b.*intel* c.*samsung*
24.*Cryptography*-secure information and communication
25.*post-cryptography*-it ia technology which is trend now a day .
26.*https*-s means secure socket layer(SSL) 
27.*SSL[secure socket layer]*-ip address[layer3]+ port number[layer4]
28.*Port number*-a way to indentify a specific process to which an internet or other network message is to be forwarded when it arrives at a server.
eg:HTTP-80
HTTPS-443
FTP-20,21
SMTP-25
TELMET-23
SSH[secure shell]-22
29.*SEVEN LAYER OF OSI[OPEN SYSTEM INTERCONNECTION]*
~layer7-application/protocol
~layer6-presentation
~layer5-cryptography
~layer4-port number[16 bits]
~layer3-IP ADDRESS[32 bits]
~layer2-hardware address-NIC,MAC
~layer1-digital(1 and 0)
30.*TCP/IP(TRANSMISION CONTROL PROTOCOL)*-layer5+layer6+layer7
31.*URL*-uniform resource locator
32.*cache*-it is a high-speed data storage layer which stores a subset of data [temporary memory]
33.*Switch* - connects device in network to each other, enabling them to each other, enabling them to talk by exchanging data packets.
34.*Virtual Machine* - created by using Hypervisor
35. *FPGA* - Field Progarmming Gate Arrays - Configurede after manufacturing
36. *Protocol* - It is a standardized set of rules for formatting and processing data.
37. *Firmware*- It is micro code or program that is embedded into memory of hardware device to help them operate.
38. *TLS* - Transport layer security encrypts data send over the internet.
39. *Stack* - Stack is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operation are peroformed. LIFO(Last In First Output).  
40. *IAM*- Identity and access management 
41.*nginx* - proxy server
42.*apache*- client server - uses httpd(d stands for dameon: continuously runs in background) that creates a pool of child processes or threads to handle requestes.
43.*ASICSs*- (Applications - specfic integrated circuits) are computer chips that combine sveral different circuits or all one chip - Its a "System-on-a-chip"
 (SoC) design.
44.*UPD*- User data gram protocol, is a commuincation protocol used acrros the internet for especially time- sensitive transimission
45.*Packets*- Its a small segment of a large message. Data send over computer networks, such as internt, is divided into packets, recombined why client computer
46.*Load balance*- It is the method of distributing network traffic eqaully across a pull of resources that support an application.
47.Von Neumann architecture and harvard architecture
48.* Data Structure*
