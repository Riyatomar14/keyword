Hi guys, I like to share some technical words which a computer science student has to study this a whole life.
DESKTOP--> Desktop mainly divided into three parts-
           1. Computation  2.Storage  3. Network  
Now focus on some terms -
CPU-central processing unit 
GPU-graphic processing unit 
DPU-data processing unit
TPU-tensor processing unit
 We see some popular company and their functions-
1.INTEL
2.AMD
3.ARM
Intel and AMD(advanced micro devices)-
They come under CISC[complex instruction set computer].It is a closed source and this is a low level language.It develop X-86 series under ISA[intruction set arichtecture] in 1978. 
ARM[Adavnce risc machine]-
It come under RISC[reduced instruction set computer].It is a close source and this a high level language.It has specific intruction,very fast and efficient.It develop RISC-V in 2023 and which is a free open source for peoples.  
NOTE POINT --
1. AMD processors are more power efficient.
2. AMD processors are more cheaper than intel.
3. RISC-V is low cost and give high performance than CISC. 
We need some OPERATING SYSTEM to store data-
1.Windows
2.MacOS
Windows-
It is developed by Microsoft and it is a close source.It is taken by bill gates.
macOs-
It is a close source and it is developed by apple inc.it is a primary source ffor apple,mac computer.
Now focus on LINUX -
It is open source operting system made by linus torvalds.It contain two spaces KERNEL AND USER SPACE.Came under UNIX[uniplexed information computer sysytem]. 
LINUX has two types of family-
1.Debian 
2.RHEL
Debian family-
It contain OPERATING SYSTEM like UBUNTU[open source,developed by CANONICAL],KALI LINUX.
RHEL[red hat enterprise linux]-
It contain OPERATING SYSTEM likre centOS,oracle,fedora,red hat.
Packing manager: Yum 
It is owned by IBM[international business machine] at 40 billon dollor.
Now, NETWORK
There are two types of network-
1.Internet[(WAN-wide area network) and it is a public network]
2.Intranet[(LAN-local area network) and it is a private network]
Now,CLOUD COMPUTING
CLOUD means internet which is a publioc network[distributed over multiple location.
1.AWS[amazon web services]-by amazon
2.AZURE-by microsoft
3.GCP[Google Cloud Platform]-by google
Now, focus on terms-
1.IP Address
2.DNS[domain name server]
3.Routing
