## **OOPS (OBJECT-ORIENTED PROMMING)** CONCEPT IN PYTHON
NOTE:
  **C + OPPS--> C++**

##  **COMPONENTS OF OOPS**

 1. CONSTRUCTOR- METHOD INSIDE A CLASS(SAME AS CLASS NAME)

 2. CLASS- BLUEPRINT OF PROGRAM
   
 3. EXAMPLE: CLASS <CLASSNAME>
   {
      //MEMBERS
   };

    TYPES OF CLASS MEMBERS-
   
    1.STATIC OR CLASS MEMBER- USE WITHOUT AN OBJECT AND DIRECTLY USING A CLASS NAME WITH SCOPE RESOLUTION(::)

    2.NON-STATIC OR INSTANCE MEMBER- ALWAYS NEED AN OBJECT TO US.
    
 4. OBJECT- A DATA FIELD WITH UNIQUE ATTRIBUTES.

   THERE ARE TWO TYPE OF OBJECT-
   
   STATIC
   
   DYNAMIC
   
 5. REFERENCE-a variable that points to an object of a given class, letting you access the value of an object.

 ## **PILLAR OF OOPS**</br>

1.ENCAPSULATION- ALL MEMBERS RELATED WITH THE CLASS AT ONE PLACE AND NONE OF THE MEMBERS SHOULD BE ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE THE CLASS WITHOUT PERMISSION.

2.ABSTRACTION- the process of hiding the internal details of an application.

   PRIVATE-WITHIN THE CLASS
   
   PUBLIC-CAN BE USED BY OBJECT OR INHERITED CHILD CLASS 
   
   PROTECTED-WITHIN THE CLASS OR NEVER ACCESSED BY OBJECT
   
3.POLYMORPHISM- WE CAN UTILIZE AN ITEM FOR MULTIPLE TASKS.IT IS IMPLEMENTED USING OVERLOADING.

  THERE ARE TWO TYPE OF OVERLOADING-
  
   METHOD OR FUNCTION OVERLOADING-MULTIPLE METHOD HAVING SAME NAME BUT DIFFERENT NUMBER OF ARGUMENT.
   
   OPERATTOR OVERLOADING-WHEN OPERATOR USED MULTIPLE TIMES
   
4.INHERITANCE- one class inherits the attributes and methods of another class. 

    notepoint-IN INHERTANCE, A PARENT CAN HOLD REFERENCE OF CHILD AND CAN ACCESS ONLY THOSE MEMBERS OF CHILD WHOSE SIGNATURE IS PROVIDED FROM PARENT TO 
          CHILD. 
    
   METHOD OVERRIDING-A VIRTUAL OR PURE VIRTUAL METHOD OF PARENT CLASS, RE-WRITTEN IN CHILD CLASS WITH SAME SIGNATURE AND DIFFERENT NUMBER OF ARGUMENT .
   
   METHOD HIDING-A METHOD OF PARENT CLASS, RE-WRITTEN IN CHILD CLASS WITH SAME SIGNATURE AND DIFFERENT NUMBER OF ARGUMENT .
