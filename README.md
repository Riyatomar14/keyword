63.**FORWARD PROXY**-A forward proxy is an intermediary that sits between one or more user devices and the internet.a client request and sending it directly to a web server, a forward proxy server evaluates the request, takes any needed actions, and routes the request to the destination on the client's behalf.

 64.**REVERSE PROXY**-A reverse proxy server is a type of proxy server that typically sits behind the firewall in a private network and directs client requests to the appropriate backend server.

 65.**PORT FORWARDING COMMAND**- port forwarding or port mapping is an application of network address translation (NAT) that redirects a communication request from one address and port number combination to another while the packets are traversing a network gateway, such as a router or firewall. 

 66.**ON-PREM[On-premises ]**-"On-prem" refers to private data centers that companies house in their own facilities and maintain themselves.

                               restrictions when connected to a fixed network.
                               
     b.client-server-computing-In client server computing, the clients requests a resource and the server provides that resource. A server may serve multiple clients at the same time while a client is in 
                                      contact with only one server.
                                      
     c.cloud-computing-Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage (cloud storage) and computing power, without direct active management by the 
                       user.Large clouds often have functions distributed over multiple locations, each of which is a data center.
                       
     d.edge-computing-Edge computing is a distributed computing paradigm that brings computation and data storage closer to the sources of data.
     
     e.cluster/distributed-A computer cluster is a set of computers that work together so that they can be viewed as a single system. Unlike grid computers, computer clusters have each node set to perform
                           the same task, controlled and scheduled by software. example:**torrent and bitcoin**.
                           
     f.decentralized-computing-Decentralized computing is the allocation of resources, both hardware and software, to each individual workstation, or office location. In contrast, centralized computing exists 
                               when the majority of functions are carried out, or obtained from a remote centralized location. Decentralized computing is a trend in modern-day business environments.   
        ![image](https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/5129222/Imported_Blog_Media/CDN_system-1.png) 
        
     g.centralized-computing-Centralized computing is computing done at a central location, using terminals that are attached to a central computer. The computer itself may control all the peripherals directly 
                             (if they are physically connected to the central computer), or they may be attached via a terminal server.

 70.**DESIGN PATTERN**-A design pattern typically shows relationship and interaction between classes or objects, without specifying final application classes or objects that are involved. 
 
 71.**SYSTEM DESIGN**-Systems design is therefore the process of defining and developing systems to satisfy specified requirements of the user.
